# Simple Expression Compiler

*) My first successful compiler project
*) Basically takes a simple mathematical expression like "6 * 5 + ( 3 / 2 * 1 )" and compiles it into NASM x64 assembly for Mac.
*) This code is spitted out to the console.
*) I copy this code and manually assemble it with Nasm for MacOS.
*) and then link it to create an executable !
*) There are many todos left, like considering unary negatives like "-3", doing error checks and exceptions.
*) These are on my list, but I want to create a basic working compiler soon, to understand the theory.
*) Lots of fun ! Hope you enjoy !!
